# Fruit Preserves

## Description

The compact nature of this app combined with Spotify’s existing recommendation function provides a quick, easy, and fun way to find new music without being overwhelmed by options. You can search using a keyword representing an artist, song, or genre that you already like. Then you can listen to the songs that are recommended. Find a track you like? Add it to your 'Fresh Picks' playlist! From there you can find out if there’s an upcoming performance from the artist of the songs you saved, that you might otherwise have missed!

Below are instructions on how to get started!
